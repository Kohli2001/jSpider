    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
        its appearance.
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img> and <input> directly
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as
    <p> and  surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not
    display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content
    of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),
    former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
    explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio,
    primarily using the <canvas> element, together with JavaScript</p>

        <h4>Development</h4>
        <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN
            researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based
            hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That
            year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for
            funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed
            "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]

            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on
            the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial,
            relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid,
            an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these
            elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]</p>
